    "In the previous lab, we already analyzed data from the March Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey (2015) and answered the question how to use job-relevant characteristics, such as education and experience, to best predict wages. Now, we focus on the following inference question:\n",

    "Thus, we analyze if there is a difference in the payment of men and women (*gender wage gap*). The gender wage gap may partly reflect *discrimination* against women in the labor market or may partly reflect a *selection effect*, namely that women are relatively more likely to take on occupations that pay somewhat less (for example, school teaching)."
